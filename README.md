Where to play your game (a link to your deployed game) : https://gabriel-yunjia.github.io/D3_Physics/

How all of your data assets (if you have any) were created: all assets were created on Piskel.com. I drew all of pixelart by hand. 

experience requirements below:
-The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player : Two players (or one loney player) controls two characters through movement and jumping and interacting with buttons and doors to play through the game. 

-The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact): Player(s) need to walk both of the character to the door to proceed to the next level.

-3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass).Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scene: 3 levels with transitions and ending scene. 

HOW TO PLAY:

there is two characters, the blue watergirl and red fireboy. watergirl is controled by the arrows keys and fireboy uses WASD control. 
The objective is to control these two characters to be at their respective doors. The doors will turn green when they arrive and the level is cleared
once both doors are green.
